Exercises Section 11.2.1
Exercise 11.5: Explain the difference between a `map` and a `set`. When might you use one or the other?

`map` elements are key-value `pair`s. We can use `map` like a dictionary.

`set` elements are only unique keys. So when we need to use a collection of unique elements we can use `set`.

Exercise 11.6: Explain the difference between a `set` and a `list`. When
might you use one or the other?

`set` is an associative container with automatically sorted elements. Elements are accessed via binary search, while `list` is a sequential container (unsorted by default) which uses linear search to access elements.

`set` provides fast read access, while `list` provides fasst write access.
