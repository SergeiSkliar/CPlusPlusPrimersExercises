Imagine a number of philosophers sitting around a circular table. A fork is placed to the
left of each philosopher. There is a big bowl of spaghetti in the center of the table. The
philosophers spend their time thinking unless they get hungry. Once hungry, they pick
up the forks on either side of them and eat. A philosopher cannot eat unless he is holding
two forks. If the philosopher to his right or left is already using one of the forks he
needs, he must wait until that philosopher finishes eating and puts the forks back down.
Once a philosopher eats, he puts both his forks back down on the table and waits until he
is hungry again.
