Exercise 5.18: Explain each of the following loops. Correct any problems
you detect.

(a) 
`do
int v1, v2;
cout << "Please enter two numbers to sum:" ;
if (cin >> v1 >> v2)
cout << "Sum is: " << v1 + v2 << endl;
while (cin);`
Answer: missed `{}` in the compound statement of the loop body.

(b) 
`do {
	// . . .
} while (int ival = get_response());`
Answer: `do while` loop does not allow declarations inside the condition.
Correct:
`int ival;
do {
	// . . .
} while (ival = get_response());`

(c) 
`do {
int ival = get_response();
} while (ival);`
Answer: not sure. revisit later.
